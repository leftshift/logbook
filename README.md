logbook â€” tool for personal log files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
%%VERSION%%

logbook is a small tool for dealing with log files, which were first [specified by Profpatsch](https://gist.github.com/Profpatsch/092ff68fa267b9fa0ccbe13e98149b21) (sadly only in german, I will add a translation as soon as possible).

Parsing and Representation of log files works at the moment, more to come!
