Got the log parser into a working state

+ Implemented Angstrom parsers
  Still kinda ugly and not perfect, need a bit of work.
- This is private
  Well not really, just testing this outâ€¦

Implemented logbook cli

+ Open & parse file with Lwt
  Why is it so hard to even open a file in OCaml?
+ Reworked parser
  I applied more applicative style, making the parser much better.
  Also I fixed an annoying bug, where you could not omit the empty line between items.
  Still not working are substitutes and proper failure whilst parsing.
